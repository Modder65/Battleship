### Placing Ships

1. **Place all your ships on the grid.** You can rotate the orientation of the ship you are about to place by clicking the "Rotate" button.

### Starting the Game

2. **Once all ships are placed, click the "Start Game" button.** This will enable the computer's grid for you to start your attacks.

### Making Moves
